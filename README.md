# Bayesian Modeling Approach to Gender Differences in the Big5

This my personal final project for the course Bayesian Modeling where I apply a hierarchical ordinal regression model to data from [Open Psychometrics](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/). I compare my results to a previous analysis with the widely-used metric model that implicitly assumes equal distances between the Likert-type answers, although the data is ordinal.
